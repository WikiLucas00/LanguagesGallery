This Lingualibre Languages Gallery is the fruits of 2 years of periodic research and developement. It started with late 2021 writing of Help:SPARQL which aimed to explore per language quantities and gender coverage. Obscure SPARQL queries confirmed our suspicions, the major geographic and gender biaises found raised the need for an human friendly, searchable Languages gallery able to communicate those findings to both the general public and Wikimedia policies makers. 

Technically, this gallery stands upon data consolidation pipeline and online publication name [Sparql2data](https://github.com/hugolpz/Sparql2data). Later Sparql refining was lead by Elfix, while responsive html/css code was recycled from Common Voice Project, with which further collaboration would be welcome.

Sorted by involvement, the following Wikimedian users directly contributed to this project : Yug, Elfix, VIGNERON, Poslovitch, Envel.

Further statistic visualisation can be developed based on this easy-to-maintain github demonstrator.
